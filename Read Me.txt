Version Number:

Version number basically defines number of the blocks in each qr code.
version 1 = 21*21
version 2 = 25*25
version 3 = 29*29
version 4 = 33*33
...
version 40 = 177*177

The code handles version 1-6.
for version 1 Alignment pattern Number =0
for version 2-6 Alignment pattern Number = 1
and so on to handle versions above 6 we need to know the location of other alignment patterns and has to be included
in permanent matrix so that they are not flipped when we do unmasking.

How to use:
1) Select a image either from the samle given or choose one of yours.
2) give the correct version number.
3) Click on decode.
